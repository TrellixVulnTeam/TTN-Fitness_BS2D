For a new dataset, three types of files are required:
	1. wig Files -> files that contain the insertion counts at coordinates at TA sites 
		a. for the H37Rv dataset, there are 14 different wig files to represent the dataset from independent libraries. For example, WX_WT1.wig, Cara_WT.wig, etc.
		b. each new line in the wig file is : TA site coordinate <space> insertion count 
	2. fastA File -> file that contains the genome sequence itself
		a. in the H37Rv dataset, the genome sequence is in the H37RvBD1.fna file [Aceession Number: NC_018143.1]
		b. It is critical that coordinates for the insertion counts in the wig files are taken from the same genome version as provided in this fastA file
	3. Annotation File -> a file that contains information related to the genes for the genome provided
		a. in the H37Rv dataset, this is the H37RvBD1.prot_table 
		b. this file must contain information obtained from the same version of the genome provided in the wig files and the fastA file.
		c. this is a tab-seperated file, with the columns:
			i. descriptions
        		ii. start coord
        		iii. end coord
        		iv. strand
        		v. protein length in amino acids
        		vi. dont care [variable X]
        		vii. dont care [vaiable Y]
        		viii. ORF name
        		ix. ORF ID

Out Folder: example output files from example flow of the scripts[see README in main folder]
	1. H37Rv_LFC.txt -> LFCs calculated for H37Rv from the 14 wig files in demodata/H37Rv
	2. H37Rv_TTN.csv -> For every TA site listed in LFCs,convert into 256-bit vectors of tetranucleotides.
	3. H37Rv_gumbel_gene_predictions.csv -> get gumbel predictions of H37Rv using TRANSIT
	4. H37Rv_expected_counts.csv -> The expected counts per TA site by TTN bias, using the STLM model
	5. Fitness_Estimation_of_H37Rv.csv -> Run of the TTN-Fitness method to determine fitness defects of the genes within the H37Rv genome
