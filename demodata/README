1. For any new dataset, there are three important files:
  a. wig files which contain the counts at coordinates of TA sites
      i. for H37Rv, there are 14 different wigs to represetn datasets from independent libraries, like WX1.wig, Cara.wig, etc.,
      ii. FORMAT : coordinate <space> count 
  b. the genome sequence itself (FastA file, its critical that the coordinates are taken from the same version of the genome provided here)
      i. H37RvBD1.fna [make sure file has this name too]. (Ascession Number her NC_0001 something like that)
  c. the genome annotation (prot_table. Critical to be same)
      i. H37RvBD1.prot_table
      ii. Tabseperated, without header. Columns are: 
        1. descriptions
        2. start coord
        3. end coord
        4. strand
        5. protein length in amino acids
        6. dont care [variable X]
        7. dont care [vaiable Y]
        8. ORF name
        9. ORF ID
